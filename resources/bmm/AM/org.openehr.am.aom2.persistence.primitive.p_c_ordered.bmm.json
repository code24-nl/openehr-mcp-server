The model constraint is a List of Intervals, which may include point Intervals, and acts as a efficient and formally tractable representation of any number of point values and/or contiguous intervals of an ordered value domain.\n\nIn its simplest form, the constraint accessor returns just a single point Interval<T> object, representing a single value.\n\nThe next simplest form is a single proper Interval <T> (i.e. normal two-sided or half-open interval). The most complex form is a list of any combination of point and proper intervals.",
